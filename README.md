Graphology
==========

Graphology is a small library to create a textual representation of a SOLID object graph to visualize its structure.


Current status:
Graphology is usable for its originally intended purpose, although extremely 'bare bones'. It needs unit tests (it was created as a spike, because I had no good idea where I was headed), documentation and a plan.


Simplest usage example: See [here](https://github.com/TeaDrivenDev/Graphology/blob/master/Src/Graphology.AutoFixture.Tests/Class1.cs); set a breakpoint after the last line of code, debug the test and look at the value of the `graph` variable.
